# Get Out and Play!

## Description

In this project we were split into teams to come up with a project idea of our choosing which incorporated all of the tools and elements we have learned thus far in the first month of our class. We were tasked with creating a real world front-end application that was responsive and interactive. We used Bootstrap as our CSS framework, used 2 different server-side APIs, and included a weather modal in the project. It was also required we use local storage and have a polished UI with the user's story in mind. Through this process we reiterated some of the key lessons from the class such as utilizing 3rd party APIs and commiting/pulling to/from local storage. Given this was a group project we were also introduced to a collaborative effort on GitHub with coding on our own branches and then creating pull requests which would have to be reviewed and approved by another team member. Our page is a website in which you can view the different variety of national parks in each state of the US. Once navigated to a state, the user is given the ability to click into a specific park which has a "Learn More" button. The "Learn More" button navigates the user to the National Park Service website with additional info about the park. The user can also choose to click the "Forecast" button, which provides the current and 5 day forecast. All of the info is pulled using 3rd party APIs.

## Installation

To install the page, go the the following website: (https://melissacade.github.io/get-out-and-play/)
Here is the GitHub page to access the project: https://github.com/MelissaCade/get-out-and-play

## Usage

When navigating to the deployed site the user will be presented with the following landing page:

![Get Out and Play Landing Page](<assets/images/Get Out and Play Website landing page.png>)

The user is presented with a drop down search bar to select a state in order to view the National Parks in that specific state. This is demonstrated in the following photos:

Once a state is selected, the page will populate with all of the National Parks, including an image, "Learn More," and "Forecast" buttons. This is shown below:

The user will then identify a specific national park to explore. They are presented with a "Learn More" button which will redirect the user directly to the page on the National Park Service website with more info about that park in addition to a "Forecast" button. As seen below:

When the "Forecast" button is selected, a 5-day forecast modal will appear for the user. In the top right corner of the modal is a "x" button which allows the user to get rid of the modal and continue viewing national parks. This is displayed below:
